# CUDA-GRAPH-ANALYTICS

CUDA-GRAPH-ANALYTICS is a planned JavaScript library for reusable GPU graph analysis in the CUDA-JS ecosystem, intended for developers building GPU applications.

## Current state

This repository currently contains the project charter, architecture decision, development guidance, and planning records. **There is no production implementation, installable package, or public API yet.** No native-provider support or performance is claimed.

## Intended scope

The library aims to define graph representations, traversal and paths, components, centrality, and related analytics through public CUDA-JS contracts.

This concerns analysis of graph data. CUDA-MCGS separately owns decision-search progression and search lifecycles. No cuGraph provider has been selected.

Implementation depends on a concrete consumer need and an accepted specification. The [activation roadmap](https://github.com/iteathen/cuda-graph-analytics/issues/3) describes candidate work; it is not a commitment that every proposed capability will ship.
